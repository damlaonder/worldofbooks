# world of books 

This is my first personal project. I started working on it because I read a lot of books and enjoy using GoodReads, so I wanted to try and make my own version. 

To start this project, I taught myself HTML and CSS, and I am moving forward by trying to make it better each day. My goal is for it to be an interactive site in which users can store their book data and add books as they please.
