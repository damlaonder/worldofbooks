### world of books 

## about the project 

This is my first personal project. Using HTML and CSS, I designed mock landing pages filled with the books I have read/want to read/am currently reading. 

I started working on this project because, after teaching myself HTML and CSS over the summer, I wanted to strengthen my skills and start creating something. I chose to focus the project on books because, in my career, I want to find ways to use technology and CS skills to close the accessbility gap in books/education. I thought this project could be my start. 

Every day, I work to find ways to make it better. I am learning data management and analysis right now in school, hoping to learn how to use databases to store book information in a more efficient way. 

All of my code is in the src folder. I also included screenshots of each page of the website in the screenshots folder. 
I am currently working on linking my css code to my html code so that the style elements will also work on any computer; right now, it is hardcoded on my computer.
